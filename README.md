1. Install conda and create an environment with python and pip
2. activate the conda environment  
 ```bash   
    conda activate <env>
```
3. create an environment using the environment Yaml file 
 ```bash    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the app
```bash      
    streamlit run app.py
```
5. Navigate to the link displayed in the terminal
6. Be amazed!
